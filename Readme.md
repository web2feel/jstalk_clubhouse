# Modern JavaScript
Few talking points on the basics of modern javascript.

## 1. Introduction to JS


 - JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to make webpages
  interactive on Netscape browser. 
 - It was created by Brendan Eich in 10 days time
 -  It has no relation to Java .
 - JavaScript is an **interpreted language**, not a compiled language.
 - An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it.
 - ECMAScript : A standardisation of JS to ensure uniform behaviour of webpages on different browser.
 - ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) : This version introduced lot of modern features to the JavaScript
 - Latest version is ES12
  
## 2. Values

 - In JavaScript, data is handled in the form of Values.
 - JS has different types of values or **data types**
 
 1. **Primitive values ( Immutable data types)** 
	  - Strings 	 
	  - Numbers
	  - Booleans
	  - Undefined
	  - Null
	  - Symbols
	  - BigInt
 
 2. **Mutable values**
	 - Objects
	 - Functions 

## 3. Operators

They are operators are used to **assign** values to variables.

    =	
    +=	
    -=	
    /=	
    %=
    ... and more

They are operators are used to perform **arithmetic calculations**

    + 
    - 
    *
    /
    %
    ++

    ==
    ===
    !=
    !==
    >
    <
    >=
    <=

    &&
    ||
    !

**5. String Operator**

The `+` is used to concatenate or join two or more string values

**6. Ternary Operator**

**7. Bitwise Operator**

**8. Unary Operator**


## 4. Variables

Variables are **pointers** to **values** in JS program.
